abstract="The amount of data generated in Online Social Networks (OSNs) is increasing every day. Extracting and understanding trending topics and events from the vast amount of data is an important area of research in OSNs. This paper proposes a novel clustering framework to detect the spread of memes in OSNs in real time. The Offline--Online meme clustering framework exploits various similarity scores between different elements of Reddit submissions, two strategies to combine those scores based on Wikipedia concepts as an external knowledge, text semantic similarity and a modified version of Jaccard Coefficient. The two combination strategies include: (1) automatically computing the similarity score weighting factors for five elements of a submission and (2) allowing users to engage in the clustering process and filter out outlier submissions, modify submission class labels, or assign different similarity score weight factors for various elements of a submission using a visualization prototype. The Offline--Online clustering process does a one-pass clustering for existing OSN data in the first step by calculating and summarizing each cluster statistics using Wikipedia concepts. For the online component, it assigns new streaming data points to the appropriate clusters using a modified version of online k-means. The experiment results show that the use of Wikipedia as external knowledge and text semantic similarity improves the speed and accuracy of the meme clustering problem when comparing to baselines. For the online clustering process, using a damped window model approach is suitable for online streaming environments as it not only requires low prediction and training costs, but also assigns more weight to recent data and popular topics.",

abstract = "Cluster ensembles have been shown to be better than any standard clustering algorithm at improving accuracy and robustness across different data collections. This meta-learning formalism also helps users to overcome the dilemma of selecting an appropriate technique and the corresponding parameters, given a set of data to be investigated. Almost two decades after the first publication of a kind, the method has proven effective for many problem domains, especially microarray data analysis and its down-streaming applications. Recently, it has been greatly extended both in terms of theoretical modelling and deployment to problem solving. The survey attempts to match this emerging attention with the provision of fundamental basis and theoretical details of state-of-the-art methods found in the present literature. It yields the ranges of ensemble generation strategies, summarization and representation of ensemble members, as well as the topic of consensus clustering. This review also includes different applications and extensions of cluster ensemble, with several research issues and challenges being highlighted."

The method can best be thought of as an analysis approach, to guide and assist in the use of any of a wide range of available clustering algorithms. We call the new methodology consensus clustering, and in conjunction with resampling techniques, it provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. Finally, it provides for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. We present the results of our experiments on both simulated data and real gene expression data aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in discovering biologically meaningful clusters.",

Forbye, it also descants three graph theories: Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Kruskal's minimum spanning tree. Then it would describe the information about the board game we choose and how to combine the game with before-mentioned three graph theories. At last, we would account for the advantage of combining with these three graph theories and the game specifically.",

abstract="Clustering suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and similarity functions that use all input features with equal relevance may not be effective. We introduce an algorithm that discovers clusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions via local weightings of features. This approach avoids the risk of loss of information encountered in global dimensionality reduction techniques, and does not assume any data distribution model. Our method associates to each cluster a weight vector, whose values capture the relevance of features within the corresponding cluster. We experimentally demonstrate the gain in perfomance our method achieves with respect to competitive methods, using both synthetic and real datasets. In particular, our results show the feasibility of the proposed technique to perform simultaneous clustering of genes and conditions in gene expression data, and clustering of very high-dimensional data such as text data.",

abstract = "In this paper, we propose a new ensemble clustering approach termed ensemble clustering using factor graph (ECFG). Compared to the existing approaches, our approach has three main advantages: (1) the cluster number is obtained automatically and need not to be specified in advance; (2) the reliability of each base clustering can be estimated in an unsupervised manner and exploited in the consensus process; (3) our approach is efficient for processing ensembles with large data sizes and large ensemble sizes. In this paper, we introduce the concept of super-object, which serves as a compact and adaptive representation for the ensemble data and significantly facilitates the computation. Through the probabilistic formulation, we cast the ensemble clustering problem into a binary linear programming (BLP) problem. The BLP problem is NP-hard. To solve this optimization problem, we propose an efficient solver based on factor graph. The constrained objective function is represented as a factor graph and the max-product belief propagation is utilized to generate the solution insensitive to initialization and converged to the neighborhood maximum. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple real-world datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach against the state-of-the-art approaches."
