Finding a good clustering solution for an unexplored data-set is a non-trivial task. Due to the large number of clustering algorithms that usually have lots of parameters, clustering results may differ strongly from each other and the underlying ground truth. With only little knowledge on the data the evaluation of which result best represents the underlying cluster structure is difficult. To find a fitting selection for this choice, different visual frameworks exist that aim to simplify this choice, usually by ranking the results according to quality measures. As those measures also have the downside of being biased towards specific structures (whether or not they fit the data) they are problematic for selecting a final result. For this reason, I propose to purely use indicators of robustness for the creation or selection of a clustering result. This is done by meta-clustering results from different clustering algorithms and calculating consensus clusterings from groups of similar clusterings. Additionally, this process is supported through visualizations, giving the expert user the possibility to use his knowledge to further improve on the final result.
